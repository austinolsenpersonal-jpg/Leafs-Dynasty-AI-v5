# Architect (Root-Level)

This folder contains **meta-level** configuration for the Architect system.  
These files define how the Architect GPT behaves globally across the project.

Purpose:
- Controls global runtime behavior
- Holds project-wide configuration defaults
- Stores cross-product logic
- Provides high-level rules the Architect GPT follows

This folder does **not** contain the in-game Architect engine for Leafs Dynasty AI.  
Those files live under:

`Product/Architect/`

Use this folder for:
- Global Architect settings
- Project-wide configs
- Future multi-product support
