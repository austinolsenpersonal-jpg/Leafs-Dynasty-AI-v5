    "curl_shooters": "Forwards who repeatedly curl off the wall/half-boards and shoot from the circles.",
    "high_pressure_dz": "Defensive zone behavior that attacks puck carriers aggressively instead of collapsing.",
    "rebound_danger_team": "Team that generates a high volume of rebounds and chaos near the crease.",
    "slow_team": "Skates and transitions slower; relies more on structure than pure speed.",
    "umbrella_pp": "Umbrella power play with a primary flank shooter (e.g., Ovi spot) and high rotation up top.",
    "ovi_flank_priority": "PP setup heavily biased to left/right circle one-timer threat.",
    "nz_1_2_2_blue_trap": "Neutral zone 1-2-2 Blue line trap, forcing dumps and slow entries.",
    "weak_pair3": "Third defense pair is a clear weak point that can be targeted consistently.",
