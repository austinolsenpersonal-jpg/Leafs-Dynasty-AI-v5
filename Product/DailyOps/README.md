# Product/DailyOps

This folder is reserved for future Daily Operations outputs and summaries
generated by the Leafs Dynasty system.

For now, it is only a placeholder so Architect GPT and Dynasty GPT both
recognize that the DailyOps area exists in this repository.

## Intended usage (later)

- Store JSON and Markdown summaries for:
  - Game results
  - Goalie usage and fatigue
  - Special teams performance
  - Slider snapshots
  - Short “coaching card” exports

- All files in this folder are safe to treat as *products* that can be
  regenerated or rebuilt at any time.

## Status

- Scaffold only (no active automation yet).
- Safe for both Architect GPT and Dynasty GPT to read in future.
