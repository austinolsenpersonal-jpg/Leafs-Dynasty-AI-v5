# Product Architect (In-Game Engine)

This folder contains the **Architect engine** used by the Leafs Dynasty AI product.  
These files directly power gameplan generation, matchup logic, runtime configuration, and strategy building.

Purpose:
- Stores RuntimeConfig versions used by Architect & Dynasty
- Contains strategy building tools
- Houses in-game system translators
- Drives the gameplan and export pipelines

This folder is the **active engine** the Dynasty GPT uses.

Do not confuse with the root-level `/Architect/` folder, which holds global meta-level behavior configs.
