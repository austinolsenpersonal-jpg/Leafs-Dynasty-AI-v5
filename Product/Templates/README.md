# Product/Templates

This directory stores all template files used by the Architect and Dynasty GPT systems.

Templates define the *structure* of key outputs, such as:

## Template Types

### 1. Matchup Templates  
Used to generate opponent-specific gameplans.  
Example fields:
- Systems (Forecheck, NZ, DZ)
- Line slider blocks
- Special teams alignment
- In-game adjustments
- Target profiles
- Win conditions

### 2. Gameplan Templates  
Reusable structure for:
- Full gameplan JSON
- Coaching card layouts
- Bench rules
- Slider guidance
- Tactical toggles

### 3. Canon Skeleton Templates  
Blueprints for:
- Strategy tree shapes
- Slider bounds
- PP/PK role maps
- Breakout schemas
- Defensive rules

### 4. Autolink Templates  
Defines how rivalry, weak opponent, or momentum-based templates connect automatically.

## Purpose
Templates keep the project stable:
- Prevent drift
- Provide consistent formatting
- Maintain Canon v1.0 integrity
- Make Architect/Dynasty outputs identical every time

## Current Status
This is only a placeholder.
Actual template files will be created later once Canon v1.0 is established.
