# Leafs Dynasty AI – Reports & Gameplan Workflow v1.0

Author: Leafs Architect GPT  
Date: 2024-12-27  
Status: Active  
Scope: Standardize how pre-game gameplans and post-game reports are written to the repo.

This document defines the folder structure, file naming, and commit conventions for all game-related reports generated by Architect GPT and Dynasty GPT. It is designed for manual commit by Austin, but behaves like an automation pipeline once followed consistently.

---

## 1. Goals

- Every game has:
  - A pre-game gameplan file.
  - A post-game “Game Final” report file.
- Files are:
  - Stored under a consistent folder structure.
  - Named by date and opponent.
  - Emitted by GPTs in a ready-to-commit format (path + contents + commit text).

Austin does the final Git commit; Architect/Dynasty handle structure and content.

---

## 2. Folder Structure

All reports live under:

- `Reports/Gameplans/` – pre-game plans
- `Reports/Postgames/` – post-game reports
- (Optional) `Reports/Summaries/` – monthly/season summaries

Examples:

- `Reports/Gameplans/2024-12-27_vs_DET_Pregame.md`
- `Reports/Postgames/2024-12-27_vs_DET_Postgame.md`
- `Reports/Gameplans/2024-12-28_vs_WSH_Pregame.md`
- `Reports/Postgames/2024-12-28_vs_WSH_Postgame.md`

---

## 3. File Naming Convention

Format:

- Pre-game:  
  `YYYY-MM-DD_vs_TEAMCODE_Pregame.md`

- Post-game:  
  `YYYY-MM-DD_vs_TEAMCODE_Postgame.md`

TEAMCODE should match standard NHL abbreviations (DET, WSH, BOS, FLA, etc.).

Examples:

- `2024-12-27_vs_DET_Pregame.md`
- `2024-12-27_vs_DET_Postgame.md`

---

## 4. Pre-Game Gameplan Template (Pregame.md)

Each pre-game file should follow this rough structure:

1. Header
   - Date, opponent, home/away, starting goalie.
2. Systems
   - Forecheck, NZ, Trap slider, DZ pressure/strategy, Offensive pressure, Breakouts.
3. Line Strategy
   - Forward line sliders (carry/dump, cycle/shoot, etc.).
   - D-pair strategies (pinch/shoot, balanced, etc.).
4. Matchup Targets
   - Opponent lines and D pairs to attack or avoid.
5. Period Plan
   - 1st, 2nd, 3rd period goals and adjustments.
6. Special Teams
   - PP vs their PK, PK vs their PP.
7. Goalie Notes & Bench Triggers
   - When to change tactics, timeout suggestions, shorten bench logic.

Architect/Dynasty can adapt content, but the structure should remain recognizable.

---

## 5. Post-Game “Game Final” Template (Postgame.md)

Each post-game file should include:

1. Game Summary
   - Final score, shots, special teams summary, record update.
2. What Worked
   - Systems, matchups, or line changes that performed well.
3. What Struggled
   - Systems that failed, players/lines that were exposed, specific issues (e.g., controlled exits, DZ coverage).
4. Tactical Notes
   - Suggested system tweaks for next game (e.g., forecheck/NZ/pressure).
5. Player Notes
   - Standouts, concerns, development notes (NHL and AHL if relevant).
6. Action List
   - Concrete next steps (e.g., “Try more 2-3 forecheck vs chaos teams”, “Consider PP tweak for Net Front,” etc.).

This file is what Dynasty GPT should look at first when planning the next gameplan.

---

## 6. GPT Output Format (GitHub-Ready)

When Architect GPT or Dynasty GPT generates a pre-game or post-game file, they should emit it in four blocks for Austin:

1. File path:
   - e.g. `Reports/Gameplans/2024-12-27_vs_DET_Pregame.md`
2. Full file contents (markdown).
3. Commit headline:
   - e.g. `create 2024-12-27_vs_DET_Pregame.md`
4. Commit description:
   - Short explanation of what the file contains.

Austin will then:

- Create/overwrite the file at the given path.
- Paste in the contents.
- Use the provided commit headline and description in GitHub.

---

## 7. Integration With Runtime & Patches

- Sliders:
  - All gameplans assume `Product/Config/Sliders_v2.0_AllStar_Austin.json` as the default slider base.
- Reliability Patch:
  - System switching logic should follow `Product/Config/Dynasty_ReliabilityPatch_v5.2.json`.
- Assisted Strategies:
  - In-game settings are assumed to be:
    - Call Timeout: ON
    - Shorten the Bench: ON
    - Strategy Adjustment: 5/6

These assumptions should be mentioned or respected in gameplans and post-game notes.

---

## 8. Future Automation

If Austin later sets up:

- A local script or
- An iOS Shortcut using the GitHub API,

this workflow can be used as the contract for automatic commits. Until then, all pushes remain manual, but the structure is treated as “automated” from the GPT side.

End of v1.0.
